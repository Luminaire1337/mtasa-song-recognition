# Lumiverse Song Recognition Service

This service was made, to be able to recognise artists and titles of songs from MTA resources and to set their metadata tags. Use this as a drop-in solution if there is no metadata available in the audio files and only if really needed, to avoid any rate-limiting with third-party providers.

This should be used in a Docker environment. To use it outside of a Docker environment, the required dependencies must first be installed, which can be taken from the `Dockerfile`.

### Configuration

All configurations are to be set via environment variables.

| Environment Variable  | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
